Codex Format Implementation

Generates .md rule files for OpenAI Codex. The SKILL.md is copied from
Agent Skills output (see convert_to_ide_formats.py); rule files are
generated identically to Agent Skills via inheritance.

Codex discovers skills by scanning the cross-tool ``.agents/skills/``
directory (see OpenAI Codex skills docs and the agentskills.io spec).
Earlier releases emitted to ``.codex/skills/``, which is NOT one of the
documented discovery paths and caused Codex to silently ignore the skill.

    Codex format implementation (.md rule files).

    OpenAI Codex (https://openai.com/codex) is an AI coding agent that
    discovers skills by scanning ``.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md``:

        .agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
        .agents/skills/<skill-name>/rules/<rule>.md

    The rule files preserve the original YAML frontmatter (description,
    languages, alwaysApply) so rules remain complete and can be referenced
    by the AI coding agent.

    Inherits generate() from AgentSkillsFormat since the rule file format
    is identical.
