"""Per-host emission targets.

``SKILL_COPY_HOSTS``: hosts that get a copy of the generated SKILL.md.
``AGENT_HOSTS``: hosts that get a ``codeguard-reviewer`` subagent bundle.

Codex is absent from ``AGENT_HOSTS`` because its subagents use
``.codex/agents/*.toml`` (not Markdown), which needs a separate emitter.
