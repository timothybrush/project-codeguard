## Prerequisites

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with how rules work in your AI coding tool:

=== "Cursor"

    Cursor uses `.cursor/rules` for rule configuration.
    
    :material-book-open-page-variant: [Cursor Rules Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules)

=== "Windsurf"

    Windsurf uses `.windsurf/rules` for rule configuration.
    
    :material-book-open-page-variant: [Windsurf Rules Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories#rules)

=== "GitHub Copilot"

    GitHub Copilot uses `.github/instructions` for rule configuration.
    
    :material-book-open-page-variant: [GitHub Copilot Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)

=== "Antigravity"
    Antigravity uses `.agents/rules` for rule configuration (the legacy
    `.agent/rules` path is still accepted for backward compatibility).

    :material-book-open-page-variant: [Antigravity Instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-google-antigravity#8)

=== "OpenCode"
    OpenCode uses `.opencode/skills` for skill configuration.

    :material-book-open-page-variant: [OpenCode Skills Documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/)

=== "OpenClaw"
    OpenClaw uses `.openclaw/skills` for skill configuration.

    :material-book-open-page-variant: [OpenClaw Documentation](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)

=== "Hermes"
    Hermes uses `.hermes/skills` for skill configuration.

## Installation

Not sure which route fits your situation? See **[Choosing an Install Path](install-paths.md)** for a comparison of rule files, Agent Skills, MCP, and project- vs user-scope installs.

!!! info "Responsible CoSAI personas"
    The installation routes below are typically implemented by the **Application Developer** persona (for file-based project and user installs), with **Agentic Platform and Framework Providers** supplying the activation behavior in tools like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode. **AI System Governance** becomes the owner once rules are rolled out org-wide through vendor dashboards. See **[CoSAI Personas](personas.md)** for the full persona model and **[Choosing an Install Path → Responsible CoSAI Personas Per Install Route](install-paths.md#responsible-cosai-personas-per-install-route)** for the per-route mapping.

### Option 1: Install Pre-built Rules (Recommended)

Select your AI coding tool and follow the instructions:

=== "Cursor"

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-cursor.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.cursor/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .cursor/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** Cursor to load the rules

=== "Windsurf"

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-windsurf.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.windsurf/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .windsurf/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** Windsurf to load the rules

=== "GitHub Copilot"

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-copilot.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.github/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .github/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** your IDE to load the instructions

=== "Antigravity"

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-antigravity.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.agents/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .agents/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** Antigravity to load the rules

    !!! info "Migrating from `.agent/rules`"
        Earlier releases shipped to the legacy `.agent/rules` path.
        Antigravity now defaults to `.agents/rules` (the old path still
        works). If you have an existing `.agent/rules/` directory, delete
        it after extracting the new zip so you don't run duplicate rules.

=== "OpenCode"

    **Option A: Skills (recommended)**

    Using skills is more context-efficient as only relevant rules are loaded per session based on the files you're working with.

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-opencode.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.opencode/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .opencode/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** OpenCode to load the skill

    **Option B: Remote Instructions (zero-maintenance)**

    All rules loaded every session, but always up to date: no local files to maintain.

    Create an [`opencode.json`](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/#custom-instructions) in your project root:

    ??? example "opencode.json with remote URLs"

        ```json
        {
          "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
          "instructions": [

          ]
        }
        ```

    !!! info "Tradeoff"
        The skills approach (Option A) uses glob-scoped rules so only relevant rules are loaded based on the files you're editing. Remote instructions load all 23 rules into every session regardless of language. Remote URLs point to the `main` branch -- pin to a release tag (e.g. `refs/tags/v1.3.0`) if you need a stable, auditable snapshot.

=== "Claude Code"

    Claude Code uses a plugin system instead of manual file installation:

    1. **Add** the Project CodeGuard marketplace:

        ```bash
        /plugin marketplace add cosai-oasis/project-codeguard
        ```

    2. **Install** the security plugin:

        ```bash
        /plugin install codeguard-security@project-codeguard
        ```

    The plugin automatically loads and applies security rules. See the [Claude Code Plugin documentation](claude-code-skill-plugin.md) for details.

=== "Codex"

    OpenAI Codex uses [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/) for task-specific instructions.

    !!! warning "Prerequisites"
        Make sure you're running the latest version of Codex before installing skills.

    **Option A: Pre-built download (recommended)**

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-codex.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.agents/` directory to your project root (Codex
       discovers skills under `.agents/skills/`):

        ```bash
        cp -r .agents/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Restart** Codex to load the skill

    !!! info "Migrating from `.codex/skills/`"
        Earlier releases shipped the Codex skill to `.codex/skills/`,
        which is not one of Codex's documented discovery paths and was
        silently ignored. The skill now lives at
        `.agents/skills/software-security/`. If you have an old
        `.codex/skills/` directory, delete it after installing the new
        zip to avoid stale files.

    **Option B: Skill installer**

    ```
    $skill-installer install from https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/tree/main/skills/software-security
    ```

    Once installed, invoke the skill with `$software-security` or let Codex use it automatically when writing or reviewing code.

    !!! info "Codex Skills Documentation"
        For more information, see the [OpenAI Codex Skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/).

=== "OpenClaw"

    OpenClaw uses the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/) for skill discovery.

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-openclaw.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.openclaw/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .openclaw/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Start a new session** in OpenClaw to load the rules

=== "Hermes"

    Hermes uses the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/) for skill discovery.

    1. **Download** [`ide-rules-hermes.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) from the Releases page
    2. **Extract** the ZIP file
    3. **Copy** the `.hermes/` directory to your project root:

        ```bash
        cp -r .hermes/ /path/to/your/project/
        ```

    4. **Start a new session** in Hermes to load the rules

**Using multiple tools?** Download [`ide-rules-all.zip`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases) for all formats in one archive.

!!! tip "Repository Level Installation"
    Installing at the repository level ensures all team members benefit from the security rules automatically when they clone the repository.

!!! note "Hidden Files on macOS/Linux"
    On macOS/Linux, you may need to show hidden files:
    
    - **macOS Finder**: Press ++cmd+shift+period++ to toggle visibility
    - **Linux**: Use `ls -la` in terminal or enable "Show Hidden Files" in your file manager

### Option 2: Build from Source

This route is typically driven by the **Application Developer** persona for local customization, or the **AI Platform Provider** persona when a platform team generates and redistributes CodeGuard artifacts internally.

If you want to customize or contribute to the rules:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard.git
cd project-codeguard

# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.11+)
uv sync

# Validate rules
uv run python src/validate_unified_rules.py sources/

# Convert rules (default: core rules only)
uv run python src/convert_to_ide_formats.py

# Or include all rules (core + owasp supplementary)
uv run python src/convert_to_ide_formats.py --source core owasp

# Copy the generated rules to your project
cp -r dist/.cursor/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r dist/.windsurf/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r dist/.github/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r dist/.agents/ /path/to/your/project/   # Antigravity rules + Codex skills
cp -r dist/.opencode/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r dist/.openclaw/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r dist/.hermes/ /path/to/your/project/
```

## Core vs OWASP Sources

Project CodeGuard has two source rule sets:

- `sources/rules/core/`: Official Project CodeGuard rules. These are the main rules packaged in releases and enabled by default.
- `sources/rules/owasp/`: Supplementary rules originally derived from OWASP guidance. These are optional and are not enabled by default.

Use OWASP supplementary rules when you explicitly want broader coverage, such as deeper security reviews or reference-driven review workflows.

## Rule Types: Always-On vs Glob-Scoped

Project CodeGuard supports two rule activation types:

- **Always-on rules**: Apply to all files in the project. These rules are for baseline safeguards that should always be in context.
- **Glob-scoped rules**: Apply only to matching file patterns (derived from `languages` in source frontmatter). These rules are for language- or framework-specific guidance.

## Keeping Rules Updated (Automated)

Typically owned by the **Application Developer** persona (repository maintainer) with **AI System Governance** reviewing and merging update PRs to keep policy current.

For GitHub repositories, you can automate rule updates with a workflow that runs monthly and creates PRs when new versions are available.

### Supported Formats

- Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`)
- Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`)
- GitHub Copilot (`.github/instructions/`)
- Antigravity (`.agents/rules/`)
- OpenCode (`.opencode/skills/software-security/rules/`)
- Codex (`.agents/skills/software-security/rules/`)
- OpenClaw (`.openclaw/skills/software-security/rules/`)
- Hermes (`.hermes/skills/software-security/rules/`)

### Setup

1. Download [`update-codeguard-rules.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/main/.github/workflows/update-codeguard-rules.yml)
2. Save to `.github/workflows/update-codeguard-rules.yml` in your repository
3. Commit and push

The workflow runs monthly (1st at 9:00 UTC) and can also be triggered manually from the **Actions** tab.

## Verify Installation

After installation, your project structure should include:

```
your-project/
├── .agents/                           # cross-tool: Antigravity + Codex
│   ├── rules/                         # Antigravity rules
│   └── skills/
│       └── software-security/         # Codex skill (SKILL.md + rules/)

│       └── software-security/
├── .windsurf/
│   └── rules/
└── ... (your project files)
```

## What's Included

The security rules cover essential areas:

### Core Security Rules

- **🔐 Cryptography**: Safe algorithms, secure key management, TLS configuration
- **🛡️ Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS prevention, command injection defense
- **🔑 Authentication**: MFA, OAuth/OIDC, password security, session management
- **⚡ Authorization**: RBAC/ABAC, access control, privilege escalation prevention

### Platform-Specific Rules

- **📱 Mobile Apps**: iOS/Android security, secure storage, transport security
- **🌐 API Security**: REST/GraphQL/SOAP security, rate limiting, SSRF prevention
- **☁️ Cloud & Containers**: Docker/Kubernetes hardening, IaC security
- **🗄️ Data Storage**: Database security, encryption, backup protection

### DevOps & Supply Chain

- **📦 Dependencies**: Supply chain security, SBOM, vulnerability management
- **🔄 CI/CD**: Pipeline security, artifact signing, secrets management
- **📝 Logging**: Secure logging, monitoring, privacy-aware telemetry

## Testing the Integration

To verify the rules are working:

1. **Open your IDE** with the Project CodeGuard rules installed
2. **Start a new file** in a supported language (Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, etc.)
3. **Ask your AI assistant** to generate code that might have security implications:
   - "Create a function to hash a password"
   - "Write code to connect to a database"
   - "Generate an API endpoint with authentication"

4. **Observe the output** - The AI should automatically apply security best practices:
   - Using strong cryptographic algorithms (bcrypt/Argon2 for passwords)
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Proper authentication/authorization checks

## Next Steps

- **Review Rules**: Explore the security rules in your IDE's rules directory
- **Test Integration**: Generate some code and see the security guidance in action
- **Share Feedback**: Help us improve by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/issues)
- **Contribute**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute new rules or improvements

!!! success "You're Ready!"
    Project CodeGuard is now protecting your development workflow. The security rules will automatically guide AI assistants to generate more secure code.

## Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Working

If the AI assistant doesn't seem to follow the rules:

1. **Restart your IDE** to ensure rules are loaded
2. **Check file location** - Ensure rules are in the correct directory for your IDE
3. **Verify file format** - Rules should be markdown files
4. **Test with explicit request** - Ask the AI directly: "Follow the security rules when generating this code"

### Performance Impact

The rules have minimal performance impact, but if you experience issues:

- **Reduce rule count**: Start with core rules (cryptography, input validation, authentication)
- **Combine rules**: Merge related rules into fewer files
- **Report issues**: Let us know via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/issues)
