# Frequently Asked Questions

## Purpose Statement

This FAQ document provides clear, concise answers to help developers seamlessly integrate Project CodeGuard security rules into AI-assisted coding workflows. Our goal is to ensure AI-generated code adheres to secure development practices without disrupting productivity.

---

## Q: Where can I access the rules?

**A:** You can access the rules in the [Project CodeGuard GitHub repository](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard). The latest stable release is available on the [releases page](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases).

---

## Q: How do I install the rules?

**A:** Detailed installation instructions are available in our [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md). In summary:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/releases)
2. Extract the archive and copy the appropriate rules directory to your project root (e.g. `.cursor/` for Cursor, `.opencode/` for OpenCode)
3. Restart your AI coding tool and start coding - the AI assistant will automatically follow the security rules

## Q: Will these rules consume a lot of the AI agent's **context window**?

**A:** The always‑on rules are lightweight and have minimal impact on the AI agent’s context window. Glob‑scoped rules only apply to their matching file types. Below are Cursor examples: left, no rules; right, three always‑on rules enabled.

## Q: What is the difference between always-on rules and glob-scoped rules?

**A:** They are two activation types:

- **Always-on** rules apply to all files and provide a baseline security guardrail.
- **Glob-scoped** rules apply only to files matching their language/file patterns.

---

## Q: What are the OWASP supplementary rules?

**A:** The `sources/rules/owasp/` folder contains supplementary rules based on OWASP guidance that informed the original rule development. These rules are optional, not enabled by default, and are intended primarily for reference and deeper security review use cases.

The official release bundles package the main `sources/rules/core/` rules. If you [build from source](getting-started.md#option-2-build-from-source) and want the OWASP supplementary set too, include it explicitly:

```bash
uv run python src/convert_to_ide_formats.py --source core owasp
```

---

## Q: Can I create my own custom rules?

**A:** Yes. See the [Custom Rules](custom-rules.md) documentation for a full guide.

---

## Q: Why does the downloaded release folder appear empty?

**A:** After downloading and extracting the release, the folders may appear empty because the rule directories start with a dot (`.`) and are hidden by default on most operating systems.

**To show hidden files:**

=== "macOS"
    
    In Finder, navigate to the extracted folder and press ++cmd+shift+period++ to toggle the visibility of hidden files.

=== "Windows"
    
    In File Explorer:
    
    1. Navigate to the extracted folder
    2. Click on the **View** tab in the ribbon
    3. Check the **Hidden items** checkbox

=== "Linux"
    
    In your file manager, press ++ctrl+h++ to toggle hidden files, or use `ls -la` in the terminal to view all files including hidden ones.

Once hidden files are visible, copy the appropriate directory to your project root. See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for supported formats.

## Q: Can I use this with Claude Code?

**A:** Yes! Install the Project CodeGuard Claude Code plugin (Agent Skill) and Claude will apply the security rules automatically while you code.

```text
/plugin marketplace add cosai-oasis/project-codeguard
/plugin install codeguard-security@project-codeguard
/reload-plugins
```

For team/repo defaults, add the plugin in `.claude/settings.json` so contributors who trust the repository are prompted to install and enable it. See the [Claude Code Plugin documentation](claude-code-skill-plugin.md) for the current settings schema, updates, and troubleshooting.


## Q: How can I report a problem or enhancement to any of the rules?

**A:** You can report problems, successes, or suggest enhancements to any of the rules by:

1. **Creating a GitHub issue**: [Open an issue here](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/issues)
2. **Provide details**: Include which rule(s) are affected, the issue you encountered, and your suggested improvement
3. **Be specific**: If reporting a bug, include steps to reproduce and example code if possible

We welcome all feedback - whether it's a bug report, success story, or enhancement suggestion!

---

## Q: How can I contribute to these rules and this project?

**A:** You can contribute at any time by:

1. **Creating a pull request**: Submit code, documentation, or rule improvements directly
2. **Opening a GitHub issue**: Report bugs, suggest new rules, or propose enhancements
3. **Participating in discussions**: Share your experience and help other users
4. **Improving documentation**: Help make our docs clearer and more comprehensive

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on our contribution process.

## Q: Does Project CodeGuard replace my security scanners?

**A:** No, Project CodeGuard rules do not replace your security scanners. The primary purpose of CodeGuard is to help you avoid introducing new security vulnerabilities as you write code, by providing agentic rules and guidance directly in your IDE. If you perform a code review using these rules, Project CodeGuard will most likely identify many of the same vulnerabilities that security scanning tools would find. However, CodeGuard is not a comprehensive substitute for security scanners—automated security tools are designed to thoroughly analyze your entire codebase and catch a broader range of issues. For best results, use CodeGuard rules in combination with your existing security scanners to maximize your code’s security.
